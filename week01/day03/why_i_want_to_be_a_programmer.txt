I’m interested in programming because I have a passion for tech, creativity, and finding solutions. 
I love the mental challenge that programming presents and the possibility of being able to conceive 
a new idea and bring it to fruition. I enjoy problem solving and creating. It’s a career, It’s an 
area that has a lot of demand and probably will continue to be in demand for the foreseeable future.
